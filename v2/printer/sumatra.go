// Windows printing goes through SumatraPDF.exe, an external helper that cannot be
// embedded the way the fonts and logo are. Finding it is the whole problem.
//
// v1 worked by accident: it called filepath.Abs("SumatraPDF.exe"), which resolved
// against the working directory (where an operator had hand-placed a copy) and,
// because the result contained a separator, made exec.Command skip exec.LookPath
// entirely. v2 passed the bare name instead, so LookPath ran — and since Go 1.19 a
// LookPath hit in the current directory is REFUSED (exec.ErrDot), leaving only
// %PATH%. v2 had also removed every other reason to run from that folder.
//
// So: search a few sensible places, and always hand exec.Command an absolute path.
